# Awesome Swift Package Manager

List of Swift Package Manager ready tools out there! As you all know Xcode 12 included improvements to Swift Package Manager, this list aims to simplify your needs as a one stop reference for most of them. To know if a library or framework is already supported by SPM "Package.swift" file should be present. If you would want to know or search the recent / published SPM libraries or frameworks you can head over to [https://swiftpack.co/](https://swiftpack.co/)

**Updated as of Xcode 12**

To add these as your Swift projects' dependencies, you can head over to **(Xcode -> File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency...)**

It also has some neat ready to use features **(File -> Swift Packages)** such as Reset Package Caches, Resolve Package Versions, Update to Latest Package Versions by just one click. All of them are self explanatory, and if you happen to encounter some of these problems before, it's more convenient to resolve them now.

With SPM being improved constantly, we might see [Rogue](https://github.com/acmacalister/Rogue) / [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) deprecated.
